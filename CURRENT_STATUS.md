# Current Project Status

## Package.json Analysis

The current package.json shows:
- Expo version: "~54.0.0"
- React version: "19.1.0"
- React Native version: "^0.81.4"
- All Expo dependencies appear to be updated to SDK 54 compatible versions

## Installation Status

Based on your feedback, the installation has completed successfully with 1126 packages installed. However, we're currently experiencing some terminal issues that prevent us from verifying the installation completely.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify node_modules creation**: 
   - The node_modules directory should have been created during installation
   - This directory contains all the installed packages

2. **Start the application**:
   - Once we confirm node_modules exists, we can start the application
   - Use `npx expo start --clear` to start with a clean cache

3. **Check for any missing dependencies**:
   - If the application fails to start, we may need to install additional Expo modules
   - Use `npx expo install` to add any missing modules

## Troubleshooting Terminal Issues

If you continue to experience terminal issues:
1. Try closing and reopening your terminal
2. Check if there are any system resource constraints
3. Verify npm and node versions:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

## Verification Commands

Once terminal issues are resolved:
```bash
# Check if node_modules exists
ls -la node_modules | wc -l

# Start the application
npx expo start --clear

# If needed, install additional Expo modules
npx expo install expo-av expo-blur expo-camera expo-linear-gradient expo-constants expo-font expo-image-picker expo-location expo-notifications expo-splash-screen expo-status-bar expo-system-ui
```

## Expected Outcome

After successful installation and startup:
1. The Expo DevTools should open in your browser
2. You should be able to run the application on your device or simulator
3. All Expo SDK 54 features should work correctly
4. No worklets or TypeScript type errors should appear
