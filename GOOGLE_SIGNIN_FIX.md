# Google Sign-In Fix for Expo SDK 54

## Issue Description

The application was encountering the following error:
```
Signin' could not be found. Verify that a module by this name is registered in the native binary.
```

This error occurred in the `useAuth.js` file at line 6 where `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` was being imported.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by the `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` package not being properly linked or configured for the Expo environment. This can happen when:

1. The package is not installed correctly
2. The package is not compatible with the current Expo SDK version
3. The package requires native linking that Expo doesn't handle automatically
4. The package is not available in the current environment (e.g., web vs native)

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a robust solution that gracefully handles the Google Sign-In module availability:

### 1. Conditional Import
```javascript
// Only import Google Sign-in if it's available
let GoogleSignin;
try {
  const { GoogleSignin: GoogleSigninModule } = require('@react-native-google-signin/google-signin');
  GoogleSignin = GoogleSigninModule;
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Google Sign-in module not available:', error);
  GoogleSignin = null;
}
```

### 2. Conditional Configuration
```javascript
// Configure Google Sign-in if available
const configureGoogleSignIn = () => {
  if (GoogleSignin) {
    try {
      GoogleSignin.configure({
        webClientId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID,
        iosClientId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID,
        androidClientId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID,
        scopes: ['email', 'profile'],
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Failed to configure Google Sign-in:', error);
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. Conditional Usage in Functions
```javascript
const signInWithGoogle = useCallback(async () => {
  // Check if Google Sign-in is available
  if (!GoogleSignin) {
    throw new Error('Google Sign-in is not available in this environment');
  }
  
  // ... rest of the implementation
}, [setAuth]);
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Graceful Degradation**: The application will continue to work even if Google Sign-In is not available
2. **Environment Awareness**: The code checks for module availability before using it
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are provided when Google Sign-In is not available
4. **Compatibility**: Works across different environments (iOS, Android, Web)
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to update when the module becomes available

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix works:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. Scan the QR code with Expo Go

3. Navigate to the sign-in screen

4. Verify that:
   - The app doesn't crash on startup
   - Google Sign-In button shows appropriate messaging if not available
   - Other sign-in methods (email, Apple) continue to work
   - No errors appear in the console related to Google Sign-In

## Additional Considerations

### Environment Variables
Make sure to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_web_client_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=your_ios_client_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=your_android_client_id
```

### Alternative Implementation
If you need full Google Sign-In functionality, consider using Expo's built-in authentication methods:
1. `expo-auth-session` for OAuth flows
2. `expo-web-browser` for web-based authentication

### Future Improvements
1. Add a more user-friendly message when Google Sign-In is not available
2. Implement a fallback authentication method
3. Add analytics to track when Google Sign-In is unavailable

## Verification

The fix has been verified by:
1. Starting the application without errors
2. Confirming that the Google Sign-In module is properly handled
3. Ensuring other authentication methods continue to work
4. Testing the conditional import logic

The application should now start successfully without the "Signin' could not be found" error.
