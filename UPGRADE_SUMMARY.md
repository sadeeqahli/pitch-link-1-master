# Expo SDK 53 to SDK 54 Upgrade Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated package.json dependencies**:
   - Updated expo to version 54.0.13
   - Updated expo-audio to ~1.0.0 (SDK 54 compatible version)
   - Updated @types/react to ~19.1.10
   - Updated typescript to ~5.9.2
   - Added react-native-worklets ^1.0.0
   - Added babel-preset-expo ~13.0.0 to devDependencies

2. **Added babel.config.js**:
   - Created proper Babel configuration for Expo SDK 54
   - Added react-native-reanimated/plugin as required

3. **Removed SDK version reference**:
   - Removed explicit "sdkVersion": "54.0.0" from app.json

## Issues Encountered

1. **Dependency Installation Problems**:
   - npm install is failing with permission errors
   - This seems to be a system-level issue with npm rather than project configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve npm issues**:
   - Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Try installing with different flags: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
   - Consider using yarn instead of npm if available

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - After successful installation, clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
   - Run the application: `npx expo start`

3. **Test Compatibility**:
   - Verify that all features work correctly with SDK 54
   - Check that the worklets issue is resolved
   - Confirm that TypeScript types are working properly
