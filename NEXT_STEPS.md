   - Added babel-preset-expo@~13.0.0 to devDependencies

2. **Created babel.config.js**:
   - Added proper Babel configuration for Expo SDK 54
   - Included react-native-reanimated/plugin

3. **Cleaned up app.json**:
   - Removed explicit SDK version reference

4. **Created helper scripts**:
   - install.sh: For installing dependencies
   - start.sh: For starting the application
   - UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md: Documentation of changes
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Guide for resolving issues

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the installation script:
```bash
cd /Users/macbookair/Desktop/pitch-link-1-master/pitch-link-1-master/mobile
./install.sh
```

Or manually install:
```bash
cd /Users/macbookair/Desktop/pitch-link-1-master/pitch-link-1-master/mobile
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Step 2: Clear Caches

Clear all caches to ensure fresh build:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

Run the startup script:
```bash
./start.sh
```

Or manually start:
```bash
npx expo start
```

## If You Encounter Issues

1. **Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md** for common solutions
2. **Verify npm permissions** - you may need to run with sudo
3. **Try yarn instead of npm** if available:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   npx expo start --clear
   ```
4. **Check Expo Go app version** on your device matches SDK 54

## Verification

After successful installation and startup, verify that:

1. The application starts without errors
2. No worklets-related errors appear
3. TypeScript types are working correctly
4. All existing functionality is preserved

## Additional Notes

- The project is now configured for Expo SDK 54
- All dependencies have been updated to SDK 54 compatible versions
- Worklets issues should be resolved
- TypeScript and React types are correctly configured
