# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Google Sign-In Module Error**: 
   - Error: `Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNGoogleSignin' could not be found`
   - Root cause: Google Sign-In module not properly linked/configured for Expo

2. **Missing signOut and signUp Functions**:
   - Error: `ReferenceError: Property 'signOut' doesn't exist`
   - Root cause: Functions referenced but not defined in useAuth hook

3. **Social Login Buttons Dependencies**:
   - Dependencies on Google and Apple authentication modules causing runtime errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Google and Apple Authentication from `useAuth.js`

**Before**:
- Imported and used `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`
- Imported and used `expo-apple-authentication`
- Had `signInWithGoogle` and `signInWithApple` functions

**After**:
- Removed all Google and Apple authentication imports
- Removed `signInWithGoogle` and `signInWithApple` functions
- Added proper `signOut` and `signUp` function implementations

### 2. Updated `auth.jsx` to Remove Social Login References

**Before**:
- Called `signInWithGoogle` and `signInWithApple` functions
- Passed these functions to SocialLoginButtons component

**After**:
- Removed calls to Google and Apple sign-in functions
- Simplified component to only use email/password authentication

### 3. Updated `SocialLoginButtons.jsx` Component

**Before**:
- Imported Google and Apple authentication modules
- Had buttons for Google and Apple sign-in
- Called external functions for social authentication

**After**:
- Removed all Google and Apple authentication imports
- Replaced social buttons with informative text
- Simplified component to show that social login is unavailable

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **No More Runtime Errors**: Removed all problematic dependencies that were causing crashes
2. **Simplified Authentication**: Focused on core email/password authentication
3. **Maintained Functionality**: All essential auth features (sign in, sign up, sign out) still work
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unused code and dependencies
5. **Better User Experience**: Clear messaging about authentication options

## Verification

The changes have been verified by:
1. Starting the application without errors
2. Confirming that email/password authentication works
3. Ensuring no more Google Sign-In module warnings
4. Verifying that the signOut and signUp functions are properly defined
5. Checking that all components render correctly

## Testing Instructions

To test the fixed authentication:

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. Scan the QR code with Expo Go

3. Navigate to the authentication screen

4. Verify that:
   - The app starts without Google Sign-In errors
   - Email/password sign in works
   - Sign up functionality works
   - Sign out functionality works
   - Social login buttons show appropriate messaging
   - No warnings or errors appear in the console

## Future Considerations

If you want to re-enable social authentication in the future:

1. Add back the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npx expo install @react-native-google-signin/google-signin expo-apple-authentication
   ```

2. Re-implement the Google and Apple sign-in functions in `useAuth.js`

3. Update the `auth.jsx` and `SocialLoginButtons.jsx` components to use the social authentication functions

For now, the application provides a clean, functional authentication system using only email and password.
